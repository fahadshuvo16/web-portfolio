            <h2>Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>Become world's one of the best web developer </h3>
            <p>I started out my career as a developer building games. It legit made me want to quit the entire tech industry. I actually switched to web development a few years ago and prefer it now. Game development as a hobby can be fun, but for a career i don't recommend it personally.</p>
